Developing embedded software, robotics, and machine learning projects in python and c++.

Check out https://github.com/RobertJN64/DroneBoat for an example of an advanced robotics project.

https://github.com/RobertJN64/TKinterModernThemes, https://github.com/RobertJN64/MLVisualizationTools, and https://github.com/RobertJN64/MLDashboard are python libraries with an emphasis on clean visualizations.

https://github.com/RobertJN64/LearningRobotv2 is an educational robotics project for teaching programming skills.

https://github.com/RobertJN64/ESP_Webserver_Template powers most of my current embedded hardware projects that need web servers for control and configuration.
